# Core Monitoring Simulator

## Project Overview
Core Monitoring Simulator is a Python-based multi-core simulation tool designed to manage task execution across multiple processing cores. It detects faulty cores and quarantines them while monitoring performance in real-time. The project features a Tkinter-based GUI with Matplotlib visualizations for better insights.

## Features
- âœ… Simulates multiple cores executing tasks concurrently
- âœ… Detects and quarantines faulty cores dynamically
- âœ… Real-time monitoring and visualization using Tkinter and Matplotlib
- âœ… Adjustable simulation speed for flexible analysis
